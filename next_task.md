## Next Task

Objective
Review remaining shared UI components (AppShell, headers, cards, side panels) for copy that implies post-bootstrap setup; adjust to availability/inspection language only.

Success criteria
- Shared UI components avoid implying Cloudflare or OAuth setup after bootstrap.
- Status/helper labels communicate availability/health rather than setup.
- Changes stay concise and avoid new guidance or workflows.

Notes
- Keep task lists in planning files only. Do not move tasks back into manager.md.
- Carryover after the runtime signals layout cleanup.
