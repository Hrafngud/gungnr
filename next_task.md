## Next Task

Objective
Add a responsive top bar layout for the Logs screen so controls fit across desktop and mobile widths.

Success criteria
- Logs view top controls wrap cleanly at smaller widths without overlap or clipping.
- Primary actions (refresh/pause/filter) remain visible across breakpoints.
- Layout changes do not alter log streaming behavior.

Notes
- Keep task lists in planning files only. Do not move tasks back into manager.md.
