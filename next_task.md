## Next Task

Objective
Add diagnostics for GitHub App template repo access so 404s are actionable (installation scope vs repo visibility).

Success criteria
- A new backend check exposes whether the configured installation can see the template repo (include request id + error detail).
- Settings/GitHub response surfaces installation owner + repo access status for the template source.
- Error messaging for template validation includes guidance when access is missing (install app on the repo owner or adjust installation ID).

Notes
- Keep task lists in planning files only. Do not move tasks back into manager.md.
