## Next Task

Build on the scaffold with real workflows:
- Backend: implement job runner persistence + log streaming, and add create/deploy endpoints for projects (template, existing, quick service).
- Integrations: wire GitHub template repo creation and Cloudflare DNS + tunnel ingress updates.
- Frontend: add create-from-template wizard, deploy existing flow, and a job detail/log view.
