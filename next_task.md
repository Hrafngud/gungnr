## Next Task

Polish DX and docs:
- Add a top-level runbook/README that covers local dev vs docker-compose usage (env vars, ports, commands).
- Introduce a Makefile with common targets (api dev/test, frontend build, docker compose up/down).
- If small, wire basic graceful shutdown/logging tweaks on the API entrypoint.
