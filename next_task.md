## Next Task

UX refinement phase: Improve Quick Services UI, redesign guidance system, add ingress preview sidebar, and clarify template deployment workflows.

Progress tracking rules (mandatory for each new Codex session):
- Read this file first and append a new entry under "Iteration log".
- Update checkbox status for any task you touched.
- Add brief notes for decisions, command outputs, or blockers.
- Keep "Next up" accurate (1-3 bullets).
- Do not list testing or verification as a "Next up" task; the user handles testing and feedback.

Task breakdown (checklist):
- [x] UI-REWORK-1: All pages content: Remove rounded containers, reduce horizontal margins to ~5%, and use custom `<hr>` separators.
- [x] UI-REWORK-2: All application forms: Create a shared `FormSidePanel` component for all forms, with a right-side slide-in animation and overlay.
- [x] UI-REWORK-3: Refactor the first form to use the new `FormSidePanel`.
- [x] UI-REWORK-4: Refactor all remaining forms to use `FormSidePanel` (HomeView deploy existing, HomeView quick service, HostSettingsView settings).
- [x] UI-REWORK-5: Refactor HomeView to a more concise, componentized approach. Break down the large view into smaller, reusable components (e.g., HostStatusPanel, TemplateCardsSection, ServiceCardsSection).
- [x] UI-REWORK-6: Standardize sidebar animations for both navigation and form sidebars. Create smooth, consistent open/close animations with proper timing and easing.
- [x] UX-REFINE-1: Quick Services improvements - Add service icons, search bar, fixed-height scrollable container matching Templates section height.
- [x] UX-REFINE-2: Redesign guidance system - Replace overlay-with-highlight with large-font contextual help on form field focus, positioned on left side opposite form, with external links (GitHub, Cloudflare) when applicable.
- [x] UX-REFINE-3: Ingress preview sidebar - Convert live ingress preview to a sidebar panel (like FormSidePanel) for visual cleanup in Networking and Host Settings.
- [x] UX-REFINE-4: Networking DNS grid - Convert 'Expected DNS records' section to a 4-column grid layout for compact info display.
- [x] UX-REFINE-5: Template form clarification - Update 'Create from template' form to only include: Project name (required), Subdomain (required, not optional). Remove Proxy/DB port fields (auto-inferred).
- [x] UX-REFINE-6: Deploy existing clarification - Update 'Deploy existing' form to forward ANY localhost service (Docker or not) with fields: Project name (identification), Subdomain (web exposure), Running At (localhost port). Cloudflare-only, no Docker involvement.

- [ ] GITHUB-GEN-2: Define GitHub App token requirements (permissions, installation flow, storage).
- [ ] GITHUB-GEN-3: Add backend plan for template catalog + repo allowlist + generate endpoint workflow.
- [ ] HOME-TEMPLATE-1: Add template repo selector and empty state in Home > Create from template.
