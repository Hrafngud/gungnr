## Next Task

Objective
Review Home, Host Settings, Networking, and GitHub UI states/labels that still imply post-bootstrap setup steps and adjust them to inspection/availability language only.

Success criteria
- No UI labels or empty states imply that Cloudflare or OAuth setup must be done after bootstrap.
- GitHub and networking-related statuses communicate availability/health rather than setup instructions.
- Changes stay concise and avoid new guidance or workflows.

Notes
- Keep task lists in planning files only. Do not move tasks back into manager.md.
