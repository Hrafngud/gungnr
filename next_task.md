## Next Task

Continue the Warp Panel scaffold:
- Backend: add auth middleware for protecting `/api/v1` routes, and scaffold job runner + `/api/v1/projects` and `/api/v1/jobs` list endpoints (placeholders).
- Integrations: add GitHub and Cloudflare client stubs under `internal/integrations`.
- Frontend: add Projects and Jobs views with empty states wired to the new endpoints.
