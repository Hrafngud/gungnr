## Next Task

Perform a major visual rework of the frontend UI.

Progress tracking rules (mandatory for each new Codex session):
- Read this file first and append a new entry under "Iteration log".
- Update checkbox status for any task you touched.
- Add brief notes for decisions, command outputs, or blockers.
- Keep "Next up" accurate (1-3 bullets).
- Do not list testing or verification as a "Next up" task; the user handles testing and feedback.

Task breakdown (checklist):
- [ ] UI-REWORK-1: All pages content: Remove rounded containers, reduce horizontal margins to ~5%, and use custom `<hr>` separators.
- [ ] UI-REWORK-2: All application forms: Create a shared `FormSidePanel` component for all forms, with a right-side slide-in animation and overlay.
- [ ] UI-REWORK-3: Refactor the first form to use the new `FormSidePanel`.

Iteration log (append each session):
- 2026-01-02: User initiated a major visual rework. Pivoting from previous tasks.

Next up (keep this short):
- UI-REWORK-1: Start implementing the page content rework.
