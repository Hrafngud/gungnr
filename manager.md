## Warp Panel - Project Tracker

- Scope: Web control panel to perform all deploy.sh tasks from a browser. It runs on the host PC (Docker, filesystem, cloudflared access) and is served via Cloudflare Tunnel for remote control.
- Core flows:
  - Create new project from a GitHub template, clone locally, patch compose ports, build and run.
  - Deploy an existing local template project (compose up if needed).
  - Expose a quick local service (any running port) via tunnel + DNS.
  - Manage tunnel ingress and DNS for subdomains on the configured zone.
  - Guide onboarding with step-by-step hints and links for required API keys.
- Deliverables:
  - Go API with authenticated GitHub login, Cloudflare and GitHub integrations, job runner, audit logs.
  - Vue UI with dark zinc skeuomorphic theme, sidebar navigation, and dedicated pages for Home, Overview, Host Settings, Networking, and GitHub config.
  - Docker Compose stack with Postgres, API, and web frontend.
- Tech decisions:
  - Backend: Go 1.22+, Gin, GORM + pgx, go-github, cloudflared CLI, oauth2.
  - Frontend: Vue 3 + Vite + TS, Tailwind CSS v4, Pinia, Axios, vue-router.
  - DB: Postgres for projects, jobs, and audit logs.
  - Host access: Docker socket bind, templates dir bind, cloudflared config bind.
- Progress log:
  - TODO: Replace placeholder notes docs with Warp Panel plans and guidelines.
  - TODO: Visual rework for dark zinc skeuomorphic theme, component variants, and standardized animations.
  - TODO: Rebuild navigation with expandable sidebar, top bar, and footer.
  - TODO: Split pages into Home, Overview, Host Settings, Networking, and GitHub config.
  - TODO: Add onboarding overlay journey and day-to-day flow polish.
  - TODO: Update login to two-column layout and popup GitHub OAuth.
- DONE: Add root README runbook + Makefile; compose smoke test succeeded (warning: buildx plugin missing).
- DONE: Add settings persistence + UI for base domain, GitHub token, Cloudflare token, and cloudflared config path (default to ~/.cloudflared/config.yml).
- DONE: Surface running Docker containers and allow quick tunnel forwarding with subdomains.
- DONE: Add cloudflared config preview in the Settings UI.
- DONE: Validation pass after Dockerfile arch fix (compose build + end-to-end flows per user).
- DONE: Add tunnel status health checks and status panel in the UI.
- DONE: Implement GitHub OAuth login + allowlist scaffolding with session cookies.
- DONE: Protect `/api/v1` routes with auth middleware and add project/job list placeholders.
- DONE: Add integrations stubs, job runner scaffold, and Projects/Jobs UI views.
- DONE: Gate UI routes behind auth (login-only access for unauthenticated users).
- DONE: Resolve GitHub OAuth callback URLs from the public host when local defaults leak.
  - DONE: Allow configuring auth cookie domain to avoid invalid OAuth state on cross-subdomain callbacks.
  - DONE: Fix GitHub user lookup to use the correct GORM column mapping.
- DONE: Implement job runner persistence, workflow handlers, and job log streaming.
- DONE: Wire template creation, deploy existing, and quick service endpoints + UI flows.
- DONE: Add GitHub template creation + cloudflared DNS/ingress updates in workflows.
- DONE: Build UI shell and connect to API for `/auth/me`.
- DONE: Add audit log model, API, and Activity UI for tracking user actions.
- DONE: Compose smoke test after audit logging (buildx warning persists).
- DONE: Apply dark zinc theme tokens and base styles for the frontend refresh.
- DONE: Replace the header with the new AppShell (sidebar + top bar) navigation.
- DONE: Introduce the new page map (Home, Overview, Host Settings, Networking, GitHub), add new views, update nav, and redirect legacy routes.
- DONE: Refactor the Home view to the Host Status + Quick Deploy layout.
- DONE: Refactor the Overview view to the host snapshot layout with container highlights, job summary, and recent activity; restyle Jobs/Activity panels to the dark zinc variants.
- DONE: Refactor the Host Settings view to the dark zinc tokens and AppShell layout.
- DONE: Refactor the Networking view to the dark zinc tokens and AppShell layout.
- DONE: Refactor the GitHub view to the dark zinc tokens and AppShell layout.
- DONE: Introduce base UI components (Button, Input, Select, Toggle, Panel, Badge) and refactor Home to use them.
- DONE: Migrate the Overview view to base UI components with shared state blocks.
- DONE: Add ListRow, Tooltip, and Modal/Sheet base components plus a shared loading state pattern.
- DONE: Migrate Jobs and Activity views to base components + UiState blocks; update Host Settings, Networking, and GitHub with UiState/UiListRow and shared loading indicators.
- DONE: Flatten the UI to a zinc monochrome palette (remove gradients/glass), simplify Home host status layout, and align login + job log styling.
- DONE: Add popup GitHub OAuth flow with /auth/me polling for the login view.
- DONE: Redirect to the panel after successful GitHub OAuth login.
- DONE: Add toast notifications and standardized inline feedback for Host Settings and Home deploy forms.
- DONE: Add onboarding overlays for Home + Host Settings with API key links, plus day-to-day guidance callouts for quick deploy and recent activity.
- DONE: Extend onboarding overlays to Networking and GitHub with refresh + token guidance.
- DONE: Add day-to-day guidance callouts in Jobs and Activity, and introduce turquoise accent/status colors for indicators.
- DONE: Add GitHub catalog endpoint (token/template/allowlist summary) and wire GitHub view to real data.
- DONE: Expand Networking with ingress-derived DNS list and Cloudflare readiness panel.
- DONE: Harden tunnel health checks with origin cert discovery + clearer missing-cert feedback.
- DONE: Tune nginx SSE proxy settings for job log streaming.
- DONE: Force HTTPS API base URL when the panel is served over HTTPS to prevent mixed-content blocks.
- DONE: Move tunnel DNS + ingress updates to Cloudflare API and add account/zone settings for jobs.
- NOTE: Compose smoke test still blocked; docker daemon access denied in sandbox when running `docker compose up --build` (run manually on host).
- NOTE: Frontend smoke test blocked; `npm run build` failed because `vue-tsc` is not available (install deps locally).
- NOTE: User will run smoke tests locally.

### Docker / Compose usage (target)
- Defaults live in `.env.example` (copy to `.env` to override).
- Build + run: `docker compose up --build`.
- Stop and clean volumes: `docker compose down -v`.
- Ports: proxy `http://localhost` (80), Postgres `localhost:5432`. API/web ports are internal unless you uncomment mappings in `docker-compose.yml`.

### Risks to track
- Security: browser-accessible control panel must strictly restrict who can run host actions.
- Secrets: GitHub and Cloudflare tokens stored safely (env or encrypted at rest).
- Safety: job runner must avoid arbitrary command execution and sanitize inputs.
